Lots to do: 
- alt color theme, and light/dark modes
- mobile responsive
- slide-out sidebars (All Users shrinks to only show avatars)
- consistent aesthetic and polishing
- Break up projects into a Phases system

Big Picture:
- Projects > Stages > Deltas (Front-End, Back-End, Full-Stack)
- Deltas can be re-ordered by drag and drop (with confirm prompt), and ordered by date added, priority, or some weighting of factors to show the most urgent deltas first
- Comments on Deltas. Clicking a delta shows a side panel to the right, with tabs (Details from delta creator [estimated time-to-complete, dependency links to other deltas, etc.], Comments tab, 
- Triangle from green->red to show amount of delta remaining before each delta is complete, and each phase. Hover over triangle for more info on progress, and who requested the delta, etc.

Long-term:
- connect with GitHub API to link deltas to GitHub issues. Automatically add comments on a delta to comments on the associated GitHub commits (if option enabled by project creator.)
- Connect other Apps I've made for more functionality, like TicketDesk API for tracking deltas, myMoney app altered to track project budget.

I'm feeling lucky button:
- Displays a random delta for the user with minimal dependencies to other deltas, minimal estimated time-to-complete, maximal priority.
- For when developers need a simple win, task while they wait, or just need to cross something off a list for the satisfaction of it

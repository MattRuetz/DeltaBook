## A Vivid Project-Tracking Web App
Made with React and Firebase.

This is an application designed to allow many users to create and collaborate on projects.
The styling was done to be eye-catching, and to stand out among other web-apps the user is interacting with.

*This is an early stage version of the app, with a default dark color theme*
